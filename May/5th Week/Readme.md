This week the data contain information about the verified oldest people. 

I had a lot of fun making this plot as I had to combine table-extraction from webpages techniques as well as I had to use advanced Regular Expressions. 

I tried to make a plot that would contain a lot of data and this is the final result.

Also I made a boxplot and a distribution plot that clearly shows that women of this dataset have lived longer than men.
