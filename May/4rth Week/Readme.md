This week the data come from the '2018 Central Park Squirrel Census' and are about squirrels in Central Park, NY. 

I examine if Adult squirrels are more afraid of humans than Juveniles, with the difference not being very important. It seems that juveniles are more attent when a human is present: 

<div align="center">

|            |Adult  |Juvenile |
|-----------|:------:|:--------:|
|**Approaches**  |5.88%  |6.67%    |
|**Indifferent** |49.34% |43.64%   |
|**Runs from**   |22.24% |24.55%   |

 </div>
 
I also made a map which shows that at the South-East side of the Central Park, squirrels are more likely to approach humans and less likely to avoid them than at the North-West side.
