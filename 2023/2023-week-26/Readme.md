This week data come from the [Historical Marker Database USA Index](https://www.hmdb.org/geolists.asp?c=United%20States%20of%20America). 

I made a map of USA (excluding the state of Alaska) whith the markers that are most at the North, South, East and West of the country, the oldest marker still existing and the states with more existing and more missing markers.
