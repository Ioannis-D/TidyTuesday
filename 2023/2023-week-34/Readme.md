## Week 34

This week the data is about [Refugees](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-08-22/readme.md) from PopulationStatistics {refugees} R package.

I wanted to practise with Leaflet so I made an interactive map using the [minicharts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet.minicharts/vignettes/introduction.html) package. 

The map shows the flows of asylum seekers to Greece, between 2010 and 2022. 
Moreover, I created a bar chart that shows the total number of refugees and asylum seekers for each year. 

The flows and the bar chart change as the year changes. You can select a specific year or press the 'play' button for an animation. By clicking the bar chart you can see the total number of asylum seekers and refugees for each year and by clicking on the arrows you can see the number of asylum seekers from the specific country.

![A print screen of the interactive map. Flows of asylum seekers to Greece are represented by arrows with different colors, each starting at the center of the country and ending in Greece. More above, two bar charts show the number of asylum seekers and refugees. The map is interactive and it changes for each year (between 2010 and 2022)](./22_08.png)
