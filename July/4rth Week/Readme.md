This week the data are the [scurvy dataset](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata/blob/master/man/description_docs/scurvy_desc.html) from the [medicaldata R package](https://higgi13425.github.io/medicaldata/).

Scurvy is a disease resulting from deficiency in Vitamin C. Until the second half of XVI century, it was not known what was causing scurvy.
James Lind conducted an experiment to 12 seamen during 1747 and in 1757 published his study A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts. 
The results of each seaman are the object of my plotting. 

I created final overview of the situation of each patient based on their treatment. 

I found really helpful the article written by Albert Rapp on [How to use Fonts and Icons in ggplot](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/ggplot2-tips/08_fonts_and_icons/08_fonts_and_icons.html) which showed me how to manipulate icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
